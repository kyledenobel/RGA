Home for all things RGA (Recording Guitar Amplifier) related.
See included repositories for code, board design, and enclosure design.

## Device
The RGA device is an inexpensive guitar amplifier that also has built in recording and effects (both analog and digital). The purpose of this project is to make a low cost, all in one device that allows musicians to create and record music. By making the one device all encompasing, it reduces the need to buy numerous other devices and greatly lowers production cost.
